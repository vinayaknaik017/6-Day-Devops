Jenkins CI/CD:

Task 1 : Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate code deployment from GitHub.

we created a pipeline in jenkins that automatically builds an application from a GitHub Repository and Deploys it on the TomCat Server.
This helped us Reduce the Manual work of buildning the app again and again whenever there were changes made to the GitHub repo.
